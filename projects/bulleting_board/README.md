# MicroBoard

The idea of this script is to host a bulleting board on a webserver based on the ESP8266 where it will read the messages stored on a file called `messages.txt` from within the ESP8266 . This will create an access point to where you can connect and read the messages and post messages on it.

What we need to do is download all the code from the `Release` folder and rename the `MicroBoard.py` file to `main.py` so it will be executed after booting up.
