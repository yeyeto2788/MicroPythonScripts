# MicroServer

This is a script that is used to serve a page using the `picoweb` module for MicroPython.

It doesn't need any other thing that the ESP8266 module to do the job.

What we need to do is download all the code from the Release folder and rename the **`micro_server.py`** file to **`main.py`** so it will be executed after booting up.

## Parts needed:

- ESP8266

## Useful links:

[Picoweb Module](https://github.com/pfalcon/picoweb)

## TO DO:

- [ ] Add real execution image.

- [ ] Better documentation.
