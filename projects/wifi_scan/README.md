# MicroWiFiScan 

This script is used on the NODEMCU Wemos Wifi running MicroPython port for the ESP8266.

It scans all available networks, it will show the strenght, name and security of the WiFi available connections.

What we need to do is download all the code from the `Relase` folder, upload the `wifi_scan.py` to the board and you do one of the following things:

* Upload also the `main.py` so it will be executed after booting up.

* Creating your own `main.py` script so it does more than the one on the folder (just scan and show available connections).

## Parts needed:

  * ESP8266.
  
  * OLED display (I2C).

### TO DO:

- [ ] Better documentation.

- [ ] Add images.
    <ul><li> - [ ] Execution images.</li>
    <li> - [ ] Board setup images.</li></ul>
